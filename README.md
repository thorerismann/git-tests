# git-tests

This repository for testing and familiarizing myself with Github's various features, adjusting to the Github style, and storing relevant guides and bits of information related to Github. This includes primarily the wiki feature, the pages feature, various markdown formatting, even things such as preparing a halfway decent readme for this repository.

There are no special indications for installation and use of this repository. The few files in the repository itself are for practice.

For more information, refer to this repository's Wiki section.
