## Welcome to the git hub pages test website

I've been using the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/thorerismann/git-tests/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in Markdown files. It is built on the gh-pages branch by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) everytime I commit to the website.

### Jekyll Themes

I selected the Architect Jekyll theme from the [repository settings](https://github.com/thorerismann/git-tests/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file, but does changing the 'config.yml' file change the theme or do I need to go through the settings tab?

### Support or Contact

Currently following the help available at [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)
